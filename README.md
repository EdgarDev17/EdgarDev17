#  I'm Edgardo Rodríguez 👋🏼

Hi! 👋🏼 I'm Edgardo a software engineer and UI designer who is constantly learning about how to enhance my development skills to build scaleable software and build a better user experience.
I'm focusing on web development, some technologies I enjoy working with include ReactJS, NodeJS, Python, MySQL, and MongoDB.
I like to challenge myself to learn new technologies and I like sharing what I learned with other people. 😀
